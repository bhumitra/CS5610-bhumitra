<h3>HTML basics</h3>

<p>
Working on HTML basics and exploring new features in HTML5.
I leaned about lists, tables, forms, input elements along with the new elements added in HTML5.
Also, I learned how to embedd multimedia on a web page. Lastly, I learned how to use the new tags in HTML5 like header, aside, section, article, footer, etc.
