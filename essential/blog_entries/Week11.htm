<h3>Project Tickster</h3>

<p> Written on : 17th April.
  I just released the Beta version for my website Tickster. Although there is an issue with the page loading. The pages are taking a lot of time to load. 
    Since I am bringing the images from Flixter, they are all high resolution images. They need to be scaled down. I am working on this problem now. Also there is some issue with the account delete. Need to resolve that.
