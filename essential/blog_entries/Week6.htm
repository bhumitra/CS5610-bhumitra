<h3>RECAP -- Angular, jQuery, CSS, etc..</h3>

<p>
Experimenting with AngularJS. Completed the library that I started previous week. I learned to use API's and fetching the data from them and playing around with it.
    Implemented the autocomplete search using angular and google maps API. 
    Redesigned my home page. Still lots to work on that.
    Experimented with the blurr effect using jquery. Will be used in my project.
    WIll start with Nodejs for next week.
