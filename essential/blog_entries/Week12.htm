<h3>Enhancing Project Tickster</h3>

<p> <b>Written on : 20th April.</b>
    Solved the Images problem. Earlier the pages were taking lot of time to load! because there was lot of data of large size.
    My home page has about 30+ images which keep on increasing as the user scrolls.<br /> 
    I used the embed.ly api to resize the images before displaying them on the screen. This has reduced the page size from 22mb to just 1 mb. 
    Now website is superfast.
    Here is the link to it -- <a href="http://embed.ly/docs/api/display/endpoints/1/display">embed.ly</a>
    Currently I am enhancing my project i have added the validations for showtimes and solved the delete account issue by changing passport js config.
    Also, still improving the website. Adding minor features to it and optimizing the code.
