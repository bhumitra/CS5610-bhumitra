<h3>Working with AngularJS</h3>

<p>
Experimenting with AngularJS. Starting from simple hello world programs, I learned to use angular JS and implement controllers to handle events, validations, fetching data from server an populating the table. The Movie library example is taken and practiced the same to implement adding content to the library. Will be experimenting with the angularJS more in coming weeks.
