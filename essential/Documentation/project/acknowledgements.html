                I take this opportunity to express my profound gratitude to Professor Jose Annunziato for his exemplary guidance,
                suggestions and constant encouragement throughout the Web Development course (CS5610).
                Under his mentorship, I have gathered a vast knowledge of latest web technologies.
                He has provided challenging and thought provoking ideas to implement in experiments and also the project ideology.
                Prof. Annunziato has always been ready to offer help.
                <br /><br />
                I would also like to than Prof. Rasala for his experiments and web development stories which helped me a lot in learning these new advanced
                technologies from the start.
                <br /><br />
                I would like to express special gratitude to my TA Rishi Katyal who has been a constant support throughout
                this course. He has always given his attention and time to my problems. I am extremely grateful for his kind
                co-operation and useful comments and remarks on my experiments. <br /><br />

                All in all, I would like to offer deep sense of appreciation to everyone for their support and remarks.
                This course is just a start, there is more to come in the future!
                <br /><br />
